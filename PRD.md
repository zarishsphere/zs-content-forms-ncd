## 3. Platform Context

This repository is part of the **ZarishSphere** sovereign digital health operating platform — a free, open-source, FHIR R5-native system for South and Southeast Asia.

**Non-negotiable constraints:**
- Zero cost — all tooling must use genuinely free tiers
- FHIR R5 native — all clinical data modelled as FHIR R5 resources
- Offline-first — must work without network connectivity
- No-coder friendly — GUI-first, template-driven
- Documentation as Code — all decisions in GitHub

---

## 4. Goals & Objectives

- Provide validated JSON Schema clinical forms for ncd workflows
- Every field must have a FHIR R5 mapping (fhirPath)
- Coded fields must carry LOINC, SNOMED CT, or ICD-11 codes
- Every label must have translations in EN, BN, MY, UR, HI, TH

## 5. Functional Requirements

| ID | Requirement | Priority |
|----|------------|---------|
| F-01 | All forms validate against ZS Form Schema v1 | P0 |
| F-02 | Every clinical field has fhirPath mapping | P0 |
| F-03 | Coded fields include LOINC/SNOMED/ICD-11 code | P0 |
| F-04 | i18n keys exist in zs-data-translations | P0 |
| F-05 | Automated validation CI on every PR | P0 |
| F-06 | Form versioning (semver: major for breaking field changes) | P1 |
| F-07 | Form preview in zs-ui-form-builder | P2 |
